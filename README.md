# Asteroids
## Introduction

Asteroids is a space-themed multidirectional shooter arcade game. The player controls a single spaceship in an asteroid field which is periodically traversed by flying saucers. The object of the game is to shoot and destroy the asteroids and saucers, while not colliding with either, or being hit by the saucers' counter-fire.

## Gameplay

The objective of Asteroids is to destroy asteroids and saucers. The player controls a triangular ship that can rotate left and right, fire shots straight forward, and thrust forward. Once the ship begins moving in a direction, it will continue in that direction for a time without player intervention unless the player applies thrust in a different direction. The ship eventually comes to a stop when not thrusting. The player can also send the ship into hyperspace, causing it to disappear and reappear in a random location on the screen, at the risk of self-destructing or appearing on top of an asteroid. Each level starts with a few large asteroids drifting in various directions on the screen. Objects wrap around screen edges – for instance, an asteroid that drifts off the top edge of the screen reappears at the bottom and continues moving in the same direction. As the player shoots asteroids, they break into smaller asteroids that move faster and are more difficult to hit. Smaller asteroids are also worth more points. Two flying saucers appear periodically on the screen; the "big saucer" shoots randomly and poorly, while the "small saucer" fires frequently at the ship.

## Conclusion
The result of this course work is a software tool created in the Visual Studio 2019 integrated development environment. With the help of this software tool, the user will be able to study the rules and features of the arcade video game “Asteroids”, as well as immerse themselves in the gameplay of this game.
One of the key tasks set before writing a software tool is to make a modern and understandable interface. As a result, the software tool can be used by both professional and inexperienced users. In the course of development, a large amount of literature from various sources was studied. Knowledge about the SFML graphics library, its capabilities and components has been improved.
The software product has been tested and meets all the stated requirements.
• When starting the game, we are greeted by a welcome window with minimal user interface and functionality;
every level In the program menu, you can select different levels of difficulty, game rules, character selection, application settings, as well as familiarization with information about each level;
• In the game space, a display of the points scored by the player, his number of lives, the player himself, asteroids, the “pause” button, satellites, coins, clouds, other objects that distract the user from the game and additional “snowflake” objects to simplify games.
The work done allows us to fully reveal the author's basic knowledge and basic skills in the field of programming. It is possible to further improve the project by introducing a multiplayer game mode and access to the Internet to download updates.
