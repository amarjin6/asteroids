# Asteroids
## Introduction
To date, there are a sufficient number of software implementations of the game "Asteroids", including their modifications.
However, the main problem with most applications is either their outdated design or their limited functionality. This is due to the fact that this game is not in great demand among users. And, accordingly, large enterprises involved in the development of gaming applications do not undertake to finalize this game.
But, despite the unpopularity of this game, you can easily find this game in the form of mini-games in the search engine. The significant drawbacks of these games are that the optimization and effects in the application look rather boring and old-fashioned, and that the applications released in 1979 and 2016 are not much different from each other. However, this problem can be solved through the introduction of modern solutions and a slight change in the concept of the game itself. For example, in our time, you can diversify the effects, add other characters, objects, slightly change the very interpretation of space, add weightlessness effects and much more.
Also, no less important criteria are the ability to choose the complexity of the game (in our case, increasing the level in the game), which is not available in every mini-game and the interface, which, in turn, should be simple and intuitive to the user. And, the indisputable advantage of the product will be the addition of different effects in the levels so that they differ from each other and the user wants to go through them all, and there must also be complexity so that the game is moderately addictive.
The purpose of this course work is to develop the application "Asteroids" with the ability to select different levels of complexity and a more detailed study of space and outer space.

## Gameplay
The arcade video game “Asteroids” software tool is designed to implement the game process on the user's computer. The main menu interface of the program. It is quite simple and intuitive. The main part of the playing space is occupied by the playing field, on which the game itself takes place. Also here are the game objects themselves, icons with the progress of the game, the number of lives and the “pause” button.
If it is impossible to complete the game, the user has 2 options:
• click on the "pause" button - the game process will end and the application will save the current level at which the user stopped;
• Intentionally lose - in this case - the game process will end, and the application will perform the same actions as described above.
Asteroids is a space-themed multidirectional shooter arcade game. The player controls a single spaceship in an asteroid field which is periodically traversed by flying saucers. The object of the game is to shoot and destroy the asteroids and saucers, while not colliding with either, or being hit by the saucers' counter-fire.
The objective of Asteroids is to destroy asteroids and saucers. The player controls a triangular ship that can rotate left and right, fire shots straight forward, and thrust forward. Once the ship begins moving in a direction, it will continue in that direction for a time without player intervention unless the player applies thrust in a different direction. The ship eventually comes to a stop when not thrusting. The player can also send the ship into hyperspace, causing it to disappear and reappear in a random location on the screen, at the risk of self-destructing or appearing on top of an asteroid. Each level starts with a few large asteroids drifting in various directions on the screen. Objects wrap around screen edges – for instance, an asteroid that drifts off the top edge of the screen reappears at the bottom and continues moving in the same direction. As the player shoots asteroids, they break into smaller asteroids that move faster and are more difficult to hit. Smaller asteroids are also worth more points. Two flying saucers appear periodically on the screen; the "big saucer" shoots randomly and poorly, while the "small saucer" fires frequently at the ship.

## Conclusion
The result of this course work is a software tool created in the Visual Studio 2019 integrated development environment. With the help of this software tool, the user will be able to study the rules and features of the arcade video game “Asteroids”, as well as immerse themselves in the gameplay of this game.
One of the key tasks set before writing a software tool is to make a modern and understandable interface. As a result, the software tool can be used by both professional and inexperienced users. In the course of development, a large amount of literature from various sources was studied. Knowledge about the SFML graphics library, its capabilities and components has been improved.
The software product has been tested and meets all the stated requirements.
• When starting the game, we are greeted by a welcome window with minimal user interface and functionality;
every level In the program menu, you can select different levels of difficulty, game rules, character selection, application settings, as well as familiarization with information about each level;
• In the game space, a display of the points scored by the player, his number of lives, the player himself, asteroids, the “pause” button, satellites, coins, clouds, other objects that distract the user from the game and additional “snowflake” objects to simplify games.
The work done allows us to fully reveal the author's basic knowledge and basic skills in the field of programming. It is possible to further improve the project by introducing a multiplayer game mode and access to the Internet to download updates.
